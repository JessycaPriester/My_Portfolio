      <p>After attending college, I became an automotive technician. Within three years of entering the field, I earned the title of Master Technician. My favorite part of my job is diagnosing, due to it challenging my problem solving skills. In my spare time I took up coding, and found that it brought me a similar joy, and I've been in love with it ever since.</p>
      <p>As a student at thinkful, I've begun my journey to becoming a software developer, and I am so excited!</p>
      <p>If you're looking to higher a passionate hardworking developer with an unquenchable thirst to learn, contact me! I am so excited to start this new journey and build great things with a great team.</p>   
      <p>In my free time I like to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pretending to be a painter</li>
          <li>Reading books about far away pretend lands</li>
          <li>Picking heavy things up and putting them down (Gym)</li>
        </ul>
