      <p>After attending college, I became an automotive technician. Within three years of entering the field, I earned the title of Master Technician. My favorite part of my job is diagnosing, due to it challenging my problem solving skills. In my spare time I took up coding, and found that it brought me a similar joy, and I've been in love with it ever since.</p>
      <p>I am a recent Thinkful graduate, and I am so excited to continue my journey as a software developer!</p>
      <p>If you're looking to higher a passionate hardworking developer with an unquenchable thirst to learn, contact me! I am so excited to start this new journey and build great things with a great team.</p>   
      <p>In my free time I like:</p>
